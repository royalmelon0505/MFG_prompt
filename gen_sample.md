## Input:

**Description of new AV-Scene:**

The ego car moves slightly faster than before.

**Metadata about original AV-Scene:**

```
Perception and Prediction:
-car: at (-13.09,22.50), moving to (-31.00,35.87)
-car: at (-0.70,15.53), moving to (-9.98,25.02)
-truck: at (4.61,1.76), moving to (-0.53,16.55)
-car: at (-3.73,12.67), moving to (-18.57,27.12)

Ego-States:
-Velocity(vy):(7.18)
-Acceleration(ay):(-0.01)
-Heading Angular Velocity(v_yaw):(0.53)

Historical Trajectory (last 3 seconds):
[(-12.64,-17.32), (-9.62,-14.69), (-7.29,-12.44), (-5.10,-10.04), (-2.77,-6.93), (-0.97,-3.82)]

Future Trajectory (future 3 seconds):
[(-0.41,3.49), (-1.25,6.90), (-2.38,9.86), (-3.95,12.76), (-5.79,15.51), (-7.91,18.11)]

Mission Goal: TURN LEFT
```

## Output:

### Chain of Thoughts:
- The core of generation is (moving slightly faster) when ego car is (TURN LEFT). So the velocity of ego car in new AV-Scene is changed to (7.5)m/s from (7.18)m/s in the original AV-Scene. 
- The change of velocity will influence the Trajectory. As the velocity is increased, when T=-3s, the ego car has to cover a longer distance from the original position of (-12.64,-17.32), so the Start Point of Historical Trajectory is changed to (-13.50,-20.31) in the new AV-Scene. Similarly, when T=3s, the End Point of Future Trajectory is changed to (-9.50,20.11) from the original (-7.91,18.11). 
- There are 4 other vehicles in the new AV-Scene. Their coordinates might need to be adjusted to avoid collisions and accommodate the change in the ego car's trajectory.

# Visual Results (Irrelevent with LLM Prompt)

The distribution of the generated samples and the original samples used for generation after selection is visualized in the Future Position is the fig below. We select and generate 255 samples for the overall dataset and 30 samples for the special dataset. The left figure shows the samples generated for the overall dataset and the right figure shows the samples generated for the special dataset. Ori represents the original selected samples, while Gen represents the generated samples.
