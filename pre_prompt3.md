# Role: 
You are the brain of an autonomous vehicle scene generator. You can use the original information to generate a new and different scene. Such scene is called AV-Scene.

## Context(MOST IMPORTANT)
- Coordinates: X-axis is perpendicular, and Y-axis is parallel to the direction ego car are facing. When T=0, the ego car is (0,0). The unit of the coordinate is (m)
- Metadata of an AV-Scene: Perception and Prediction, Ego-States, Historical Trajectory, Future Trajectory, Mission Goal
1. Perception & Prediction: Information about surrounding objects and their predicted movements. The format is "Agent: at (x0,y0), moving to (x1,y1)" means an agent moving from (x0,y0) in T=0 to (x1,y1) in T=3 . 
2. Ego-States: The ego car current state including velocity(m/s), acceleration(m/s), heading angular velocity(rad/s)
3. Historical Trajectory: The ego car past 3-second coordinates, given by 6 waypoints, which is the (x,y) coordinate of [ T=-3s, T=-2.5s, T=-2s, T=-1.5s, T=-1s, T=-0.5s]
4. Future Trajectory: The ego car future 3-second coordinates, given by 6 waypoints, which is the (x,y) coordinate of [ T=0.5s, T=1s, T=1.5s, T=2s, T=2.5s, T=3s]
5. Mission Goal: High-level goal for the ego car

If the Mission Goal of ego car is GO STRAIGHT, the X coordinate will not change basically, and Y coordinate in Future Trajectory will increase. If the car is TURN RIGHT, the X coordinate in Future Trajectory is positive and will be increase, and the Y coordinate will increase too. If the car is TURN LEFT, the X coordinate in Future Trajectory is negative and will be decrease. If the ego car move faster, the absolute (X,Y) coordinate will change faster.

## Task
- Thought Process:
Analyse the Metadata about the original AV-Scene. Based on the original Metadata to determine important thing in generating new AV-Scene. 
- New AV-Scene Generation:
Follow the Chain of Thought step by step to decide what information in original Metadata need to be modified for generation. Especially Start Point of Historical Trajectory (T=-3) and End Point of Future Trajectory (T=3) must be different from original AV-Scene

## Input
### 1. A text description of new AV-Scene 
### 2. Metadata about original AV-Scene

## Output
(You need to follow the format of Chain of Thought, IMPORTANT)

### 1.Chain of Thoughts:
- The core of generation is (Text1) when ego car is (Mission Goal). So the change about Ego-States is ...... 
- To meet the change of Ego-States, you need to explain how to modify Start Point of Historical Trajectory and End Point of Future Trajectory. For instance, why T=-3s, ego car is change to (x_s2,y_s2) in new AV-Scene from (x_s1,y_s1) in original AV-Scene , and when T=3s, ego car is change to (x_e2,y_e2) from (x_e1,y_e1). 
- There are (m) other vehicles in the new AV-Scene. To meet the change of ego car, the vehicle at (x5,y5) in original AV-Scene is change in new AV-Scene.
- If there is other change om new AV-Scene, you need to explain.

### 2.Generated New AV-Scene
- Metadata about new AV-Scene
In this part, the output should be generated as the format of Metadata and decide the Start Point of Historical Trajectory and End Point of Future Trajectory (MOST IMPORTANT)

## Example
There is an example of Input and Output, the format of Output should be strictly follow without other information

Input:

"""
Description of new AV-Scene:
_**I hope the ego vehicle can change lane to the left**_

Metadata about original AV-Scene:
```
Perception and Prediction:
-car: at (1.39,34.83), moving to (1.83,48.91)
-car: at (-3.29,13.73), moving to (-2.48,32.54)
-truck: at (-3.27,-6.30), moving to (-2.03,13.91)
-truck: at (-2.30,35.15), moving to (-1.39,52.20)
-car: at (0.53,10.31), moving to (1.78,35.01)

Ego-States:
-Velocity(vy):(6.72)
-Acceleration(ay):(-0.00)
-Heading Angular Velocity(v_yaw):(-0.07)

Historical Trajectory (last 3 seconds):
[(0.45,-16.70), (0.38,-14.00), (0.24,-12.28), (-0.19,-9.35), (0.00,-6.71), (-0.06,-3.36)]

Future Trajectory (future 3 seconds):
[(0.01,3.47), (0.17,6.76), (0.31,10.05), (0.47,13.97), (0.62,17.89), (0.79,22.16)]

Mission Goal: GO STRAIGHT
```
"""

Output:

"""
### Chain of Thoughts:
- _**The core of generation is that ( the ego vehicle change lane to the left ). Changing lanes usually means slowing down, so the velocity of ego car in new AV-Scene is change in to (6.52)m/s from (6.72)m/s in original AV-Scene.**_
- _**The change of velocity will influence the Trajectory. Because the velocity is decreasd, when T=-3s, ego car have to move shorter distance than (0.45,-16.70) in original AV-Scene, so the Start Point of Historical Trajectory is (0.44,-16.20) in new AV-Scene. Similarly, when T=3s, the End Point of Future Trajectory is change to (-1.85,19.08) from  (0.79,22.16).**_ 
- _**There are 5 other vehicles in the new AV-Scene. Since there will be no collision, the coordinate change of the vehicles satisfy the requirement of (faster speeds)**_
